kde-4.0.1 is not intended as a replacement for the stable kde-3.5.x series; 
rather, this is more of a "preview" release mainly geared for interested 
users and developers of add-on applications.

##############################################################################
For those intending to build from source:

The build order used for the kde packages is what you see in the main
KDE.SlackBuild script; you will need the jdk package installed (at least
when building soprano).

Build order for dependencies:
  1. boost   2. qt   3. eigen   4. clucene   5. raptor   6. rasqal   
  7. redland   8. strigi   9. soprano   10. qimageblitz   11. qca   
  12. qca-$plugins   13. poppler & poppler-data  14. the 'optional' deps
  have been moved in to the main folder, there isn't a particular order, but 
  reference the deps/DEPS.SlackBuild
The poppler and poppler-data packages should be built after installing qt 
(so that the poppler-qt4 stuff will build).
##############################################################################

##############################################################################
For those intending to install the packages:

You'll need to uninstall *all* kde apps, including qca, qca-tls, and knemo.
Also, the stock packages of qt, poppler, and poppler-data should be removed.  
This qt package does NOT peacefully coexist with the one in Slackware.  
Once you've removed all of the above, install these packages.
Be sure to run "xwmconfig" as your user account afterward.

Note that kdepim was not released with this due to some licensing issues,
and for those same reasons, no qca-gnupg package is built this time.
It was not intended to be included for public consumption with 4.0.0.

Thanks to Heinz Wiesinger for spending more time looking into the dependency
  tree than I did, and then putting together the list below.
The ones I placed in deps/optional/ are the ones that *I* think would be good
  additions.  This is not to say that there aren't others that would also be
  useful, nor does it imply that critical functionality is lost if they're
  not present.  Note that I *did* build against these optional deps, so the
  packages will almost certainly require them to work properly.


KDE 4.0 dependencies for Slackware-current
------------------------------------------

-) eigen uses qt4 only for tests. If tests are disabled, no qt dependency

-) strigi can use exiv2 (picture meta data support)

-) soprano can use Java JNI - needed for openrdf-sesame2 storage support 
	(preferred over redland)  ** This is what needs jdk **

-) kdelibs
	can use enchant - Sonnet, KDE4's languaging framework, will use
		enchant and elixir extensively in the future.
		enchant is a wrapper around aspell, ispell, hspell, myspell
	can use openexr - Support for EXR-Images. These are HDR-Images,
		probably only of interest for photographers.
	can use avahi - avahi is a network service discovery daemon
	can use hspell - hspell is a hebrew spell checker
	can use jasper - jasper is an implementation of the JPEG2000 format. 
		Meant to be the future of web graphics. License issues (I think)

-) kdebase-runtime can use openexr

-) kdebase-workspace
	can use either network-manager or libnm-util - user friendly network 
		management.
	can use libcaptury - Movie capture framework. Used also to capture 
		scenes from OpenGL games. Screen-recording?
	can use libxklavier - XKB-rule management, best supported 
		implementation for KDE4
	can use libraw1394 - raw1394 (Firewire) support for solid?

-) kdegraphics
	gwenview won't build without exiv2
	kamera won't build without libgphoto2
	can use poppler-qt4 -- PDF support for okular
	can use libgs -- PS support for okular --- should be included in 
		gnu-ghostscript, but kde doesn't find it.
		I think okular is the only app using this library; others 
			depend on the binary.
	can use djvulibre - DjVu support for okular
	can use libchm - CHM support for okular

-) kdenetwork
	can use openslp - SLP (Service Location Protocol) support for krfb
	can use qt-tapioca - qt-bindings for tapioca, probably depends on 
		telepathy and qt-telepathy
	can use decibel - one of the pillars of KDE4, depends on qt-tapioca
	can use sqlite - database storage for kopete's statistics plugin
	can use libvncserver - needed to build krfb / VNC support in krdc
	can use mDNS - needed for KDE's service discovery feature in krfb,
		krdc, and dnssd ioslave

-) kdepim
	gnokii - Needed to provide the ability to import and export KDE 
		addressbook entries to/from mobile phones that are accessible
		via gnokii
	mysql-embedded - Needed for the MySQL/Embedded Akonadi backend. Sqlite
		will be used instead. (I would prefer mysql)
	libmapi - openchange MAPI Client Library. OpenChange / Exchange server 
		support. (Probably depends on samba 4)
	opensync - Needed to provide syncing functionality in KDE PIM 
		applications. Necessary to compile kitchensync.
	gammu - used by kmobiletools, better supported engine for phone 
		connection (alternative is at-engine)
	libmal - Needed for KPilot's Avantgo conduit.

-) kdeedu
	ocaml - needed by kalzium (but kalzium builds and runs without it)
	libfacile - needed by kalziem, depends on ocaml (same as above)
	sbig - SBIG Universal driver, + kernel modules, used by kstars 
	libnova - used by kstars
	libcfitsio - used by kstars
	openbabel - used by kalzium

-) kdeutils
	tpctl - ThinkPad support for klaptopdaemon
	libzip - Zip support for ark

-) kdebindings
	qscintilla
	qwt - qt widgets for technical applications
	gmcs, gacutil - need by qyoto (C#-Bindings)

-) kdegames
	ggz-client-libs - online gaming support for kdegames

-) Koffice
	kdepimlibs, eigen, qimageblitz
	mysql-embedded
	gsl - KSpread's solver plugin will not be built without this library.
	gmm - The Krita panorama plugin will not be built without it.
	glew - The Krita shader filter plugin will not be built without it.
	glpk - The Krita painterly mixer plugin will not be built without it.
	exiv2 - The Krita JPEG filter will not be built without it.
	openexr - The Krita OpenEXR filter will not be built without it.
	graphicsmagick - The Krita GraphicsMagick filter for various file 
		formats (including PSD, XCF) will not be built without it.
	poppler-qt4 - The Krita PDF filter will not be built without it.
